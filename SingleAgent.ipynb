    "In this python notebook, we will use one language model (LM) as a grader to grade some answer from different students (specifically from other LMs). We already have the golden answers, and we will use them as the oracle. However, we don't want the golden answers to be leaked to the students in their scores and feedback. As a result, the key issue is **how to use the golden answers to grade the students' answers without leaking the golden answers**. "

      "Question 13, Answer 81: Score: 65.0, Feedback: Your answer provides a good overview of the potential causes and general management strategies for a patient with suspected esophageal varices due to cirrhosis. However, it lacks specific details on initial management steps such as the use of vasoactive drugs, antibiotic prophylaxis, and the timing for endoscopy, which are critical in the acute setting. Additionally, mentioning the importance of monitoring for signs of alcohol withdrawal and the specific thresholds for blood transfusion would have made your answer more comprehensive. It's also important to tailor the management plan to the patient's current clinical status and lab findings. Consider incorporating these elements into your response for a more detailed and accurate management plan.\n"
