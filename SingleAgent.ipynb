    "In this python notebook, we will use one language model (LM) as a grader to grade some answer from different students (specifically from other LMs). We already have the golden answers, and we will use them as the oracle. However, we don't want the golden answers to be leaked to the students in their scores and feedback. As a result, the key issue is **how to use the golden answers to grade the students' answers without leaking the golden answers**. "

      "Question 13, Answer 21: Score: 45.0, Feedback: Your answer has several key areas for improvement. Firstly, it's crucial to include antibiotic therapy in the management plan to prevent infections, which is a common complication in such cases. Additionally, the use of vasoactive medications like octreotide or terlipressin is essential for managing variceal bleeding, but was not mentioned. While you suggested the use of blood products, it's important to specify the conditions under which they are recommended, as their indiscriminate use is not advised. The omission of the need for an upper endoscopy within a specific timeframe is a significant gap, as this procedure is critical for diagnosis and management. Furthermore, addressing potential complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and outlining specific criteria for blood transfusion are necessary components of a comprehensive management plan. The consideration of a TIPS procedure should be based on specific findings rather than suggested as an immediate step. Lastly, monitoring and managing potential alcohol withdrawal symptoms is an important aspect that was overlooked. Enhancing your answer to include these elements would provide a more complete and expert-aligned approach to managing this patient.\n",
