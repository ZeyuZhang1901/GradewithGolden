We already have the golden answers, and we will use them as the oracle. However, we don't want the golden answers to be leaked to the students in their scores and feedback. As a result, the key issue is **how to use the golden answers to grade the students' answers without leaking the golden answers**. "

You've correctly identified the general 24-hour guideline for UGIB and the more urgent 12-hour window for suspected variceal bleeding, which is crucial for optimal patient management. To further improve, consider discussing the evidence strength or the lack thereof supporting these recommendations, as some experts note the evidence for the 12-hour window in variceal bleeding is not robust.

      "Question 13, Answer 1: Score: 55.0, Feedback: Your answer covers some important aspects of managing a patient with suspected variceal bleeding due to cirrhosis, but there are several key elements missing or inaccurately included that are crucial for comprehensive care. 1) It's important to specify the use of antibiotics like ceftriaxone for infection prophylaxis in these patients, which was not mentioned. 2) The inclusion of vasoactive medications such as octreotide is critical for managing variceal bleeding, and your answer lacked this detail. 3) Timing for endoscopy is essential for optimal outcomes, and should be performed within 12-24 hours. 4) Criteria for blood transfusion based on hemoglobin levels need to be discussed to guide appropriate management. 5) The use of lactulose for preventing hepatic encephalopathy is a key management step that was omitted. 6) While mentioning TIPS is good, elaborating on its use in severe cases is necessary for a complete answer. 7) The mention of the Rockall score, although useful in some contexts, is not standard in the management of variceal bleeding and was not expected in this answer. 8) Details on the duration of vasoactive drugs and antibiotics are important for treatment planning and were missing. 9) Lastly, the consideration of PPI use before endoscopy and its potential discontinuation based on findings is an important aspect that was not covered.\n",

      "Question 13, Answer 21: Score: 45.0, Feedback: Your answer has several key areas for improvement. Firstly, it's crucial to include antibiotic therapy in the management plan to prevent infections, which is a common complication in such cases. Additionally, the use of vasoactive medications like octreotide or terlipressin is essential for managing variceal bleeding, but was not mentioned. While you suggested the use of blood products, it's important to specify the conditions under which they are recommended, as their indiscriminate use is not advised. The omission of the need for an upper endoscopy within a specific timeframe is a significant gap, as this procedure is critical for diagnosis and management. Furthermore, addressing potential complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and outlining specific criteria for blood transfusion are necessary components of a comprehensive management plan. The consideration of a TIPS procedure should be based on specific findings rather than suggested as an immediate step. Lastly, monitoring and managing potential alcohol withdrawal symptoms is an important aspect that was overlooked. Enhancing your answer to include these elements would provide a more complete and expert-aligned approach to managing this patient.\n",

      "Question 13, Answer 61: Score: 45.0, Feedback: Your answer has several areas that need improvement to align with the comprehensive management of a patient with suspected variceal bleeding due to cirrhosis. Here are some key points to consider: \n",
      "1. It's important to include antibiotic therapy as part of the initial management to prevent infections, which are common in these patients. \n",
      "2. Vasoactive medications play a crucial role in controlling bleeding and should not be omitted from your management plan. \n",
      "3. An upper endoscopy is critical for diagnosing and potentially treating the source of bleeding; mentioning the timing for this procedure is essential. \n",
      "4. Discussing the criteria for blood transfusion, including the hemoglobin threshold, would make your answer more comprehensive. \n",
      "5. Prophylactic measures against complications like hepatic encephalopathy and infections are important considerations in the management of these patients. \n",
      "6. Be cautious with clinical inferences such as the significance of asterixis; focus on direct management strategies. \n",

It's important to include the immediate use of antibiotic therapy in the management plan, as this is a standard recommendation. 2. The use of vasoactive medications like octreotide or terlipressin plays a significant role in managing such patients and should not be omitted. 3. Timing for endoscopy is critical and should be specified to be within 12-24 hours. 4. Monitoring hemoglobin levels and understanding when blood transfusions are necessary are essential components of care. 5. Prophylactic measures against infections, including the use of specific antibiotics, are missing from your answer. 6. Consideration for the prevention of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose is also a recommended practice. 7. The potential use of PPIs before endoscopy and the specifics of endoscopic therapies are important details that need to be included. 8.
